# Line Transect Sampling with Simulated Data

To perform the analysis, you will need to run the following R code:

```R
# Install and load the Distance package
install.packages("Distance")
library(Distance)

# Generate simulated data
set.seed(42)
simulated_data <- data.frame(
  TransectID = rep(1:10, each = 10),
  SpeciesID = sample(c("A", "B"), 100, replace = TRUE),
  Individuals = sample(1:5, 100, replace = TRUE),
  Distance = runif(100, min = 0, max = 100)
)

# Fit detection function
detection_function <- ds(
  data = simulated_data,
  distance = "Distance",
  key = "hn",
  adjustment = "cos",
  convert.units = 1
)

# Estimate abundance
abundance_estimates <- dht(
  model = detection_function,
  flatfile = simulated_data,
  strat_formula = ~1,
  by = "SpeciesID"
)

# Extract abundance estimates for each species
species_abundance <- abundance_estimates$individuals$D

# Plot the detection function
plot(detection_function)

# Print estimated abundance for each species
print(species_abundance)
